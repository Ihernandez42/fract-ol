The term fractal was first used by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.
in 1974, was based on the Latin word fractus, which means “broken” or “fractured.”
A fractal is an object of mathematical abstraction, such as a curve or surface, that retains a similar pattern regardless of scale.
Several natural phenomena such as Romanesco have some of the characteristics of fractals.

## Features
This project consists of multiple fractals:
- Mandelbrot
- Julia
- BurningShip
- Mandelbox

We must increase and decrease the maximum iteration for the calculation of the shape, as well as Enlarge and reduce the zoom, we also have multiple color patterns.

## how to use fract-ol?

```
$> make
$> ./fractol Mandelbrot
$> ./fractol Julia
$> ./fractol Burningship
$> ./fractol Mandelbox
```

# Extras 
This new project will be an opportunity to get familiar with miniLibX (complex function library provided by school 42).
In addition, it will be essential for us to know and apply the mathematical notion of complex numbers and let's take a look
to the concept of CGI optimization and event management.
